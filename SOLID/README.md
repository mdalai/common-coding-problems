The SOLID Principles are:
- SRP (Single Responsibility Principle): "A class should have one, and only one, reason to change"
- OCP (Open Closed Principle): "Software entities ... should be open for extension but closed for modification"
- LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle): "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it"
- ISP (Interface Segregation Principle): "Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface"
- DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle): "Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstraction. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions"
